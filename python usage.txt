I used python as a backend tech for the user authentication of restaurant website.
How to run app.py?
First, Install flask in IDE.
Then write the command "python app.py" in your IDE.
Then use the address generated in browser to use the website.
Python used in this website creates a local database for storing the user credentials for authentication.
